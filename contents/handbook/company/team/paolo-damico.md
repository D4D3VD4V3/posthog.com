## Q1 2022 Goals
- **Product strategy.**
  - 2x ambitious Product milestones (like Experimentation). Strategy >> Execution. Exciting/evangelism.
  - Decentralize & scale customer feedback loop with Customer Success Team.
  - Scale (make sure it works optimally) Design work with Eng Teams.
  - Bring more industry context. TODO:
  - Great handle on our numbers. Discover opportunities in data (increase Discoveries from this). Excite others to do this.
- **Product execution.**
  - Owners have all context for sprint planning, updated roadmaps and no blockers. Particularly, sprint goals should be well justified (very clear, no fluff on why) with data before sprint planning meeting.
  - Coding and PR reviews (except UX reviews) < 20% of my time.
  - Adjust work style to different Engineers. Less/more hands on / scoping.
  - Increase Discoveries / active users > x%

## Q4 2021 Goals

### Retrospective
Coming soon.

### Planning

- **Product strategy.**
  - ⭐️ Build the _core product_ strategy for Q4-21. _Likely related to Collaboration, Experimentation and "Making more successful products". These will be very ambitious goals, that will directly impact company-level metrics (see [Product metrics](/handbook/product/metrics))._
  - Support Exec Team with context, feedback and any other activity in shaping up the product strategy for the next quarter/year. In particular, ensure we have clear company-level product metrics and we have a plan for improving them.
- **Product execution.**
  - ⭐️ Ensure ownership and accountability on every key feature by a single engineer, particularly with defining clear and ambitious goals for each epic in each sprint. _Help owners improve on workflow, prioritization, solution scoping (particularly around overscoping) & post-delivery._
  - Clearly define what success is for each milestone.
  - Successful (*see above*) delivery of all milestones from product strategy.
- **User experience.**
  - ⭐️ Develop a strong culture within Product & Engineering for the quality bar of features. Improve the bar for core shipped features, lower the bar for MVPs.
  - Improve iteration speed by removing me as a dependency for code reviews and PRs.
- **Enterprise & Growth support.**
  - Ensure the essential set of 1) enterprise and 2) revenue features are built in a timely manner (including prioritization, scoping, context sharing) to unblock customers. _Right trade-off between never blocking enterprise customers and ensuring resources are only used when needed._
